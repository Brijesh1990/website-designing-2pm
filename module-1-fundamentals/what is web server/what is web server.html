  web server is used to send or give permission to load content on web broswers 
  or 

  web server is a computer program that accepts requests from clients (web browsers) and delivers the requested web pages, images, scripts, and other files to the client. web servers are typically installed on computer servers or dedicated servers.

  web server is a critical component of the internet infrastructure, enabling users to access and interact with the world wide web. Web servers handle requests from clients, process the requested content, and deliver it to the clients' web browsers. By providing a reliable and efficient way to serve web content, web servers contribute to the overall performance and availability of the internet.

  web servers can be classified into two main types:

  static web servers:
  static web servers store web content in files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other files) and serve the content directly to clients without any intervention. Static web servers are typically simpler and faster than dynamic web servers, but they may not be able to handle complex web applications or provide real-time updates.

  dynamic web servers:
  dynamic web servers, on the other hand, use scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) to generate web content dynamically based on the client's requests. Dynamic web servers can process and generate content on-the-fly, allowing them to serve complex web applications and provide real-time updates. Dynamic web servers are typically more complex and slower than static web servers, but they can handle more advanced web applications and provide better performance.
