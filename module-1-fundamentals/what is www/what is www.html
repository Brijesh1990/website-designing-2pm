what is www  ? 

  www : www stands for world wide web 
  It is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses hypertext to link documents. Hypertext is a form of data interchange where information is stored and accessed through hyperlinks. The World Wide Web is a collection of interconnected documents, websites, and applications that allow users to access, share, and collaborate on information. The primary purpose of the World Wide Web is to facilitate the sharing and dissemination of information, such as news, documents, images, and videos.


  Hyperlinks are the primary means of linking documents on the World Wide Web. They consist of two parts: the source URL (the URL of the document being linked to) and the target URL (the URL of the document that is being linked). When a user clicks on a hyperlink, their web browser sends a request to the target URL, and the browser loads the content of the target URL into the current page. This allows users to navigate through a web of documents and access information from multiple sources.
